#tuple cant modify and cant add  new item
#tuple are immutable (cant change)
#it is just like list 

#in count methods you can count total number occurance of number
#in index you find out first occurace of an item

#thew method you cant change tuple can only access and get information


#number=(1,2,3)
#print(number[0])


#unpacking  [this is available in list and tuple both]
cordinate=[1,2,3]

"""
x=cordinate[0]
y=cordinate[1]
z=cordinate[2]

#similar but quick 

x,y,z=cordinate
